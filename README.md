# Hack-the-pd
This a small hacking application build by me on java platform.
This application finds its maximum utility use used as a service 
Once after executing it continously looking for any external drive to be connected to the machine and on dedecting it copies all the data of the device
and stores it to a specified location in .zip format without the master of pd being known all that happening :))
